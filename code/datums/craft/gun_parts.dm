/*
These are the individual parts that fit into a gun. If you make any unique gun parts, such as a new caliber or mechanism for.. whatever reason, it needs to go here.
Steel parts are for bootleg firearms, such as handmade firearms, low-tier / trash guns, and the like. Plasteel parts are for normal firearms.

Possible TO:DO for future coding:
Make it so steel parts fit into any gun you want but can 'break', or cause jams. Allows bootleg high-quality firearms but comes with downsides to cheapness.
