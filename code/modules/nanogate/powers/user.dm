// The powers here are centered around upgrading the user.
/*
List of powers in this page :
- Regeneration : Give the user a perk that constantly heal himself at a very slow rate defined in the perk itself.
- Speed Booster : Give the user a perk that make him move faster, the speed increase being defined in the perk itself.
- Armor Upgrade : Give the user a perk that reduce damage, again the precise number is defined in the perk given.
- Chemical Injection : Allow the user to choose a type of nanite chem to inject himself, then give him a perk that will do the injection when the user want.
- Tool/Gun Mods : Give the user a modification that they chose from a list. The only reusable power.
- Nanite Ammo : Give the user a perk that can spawn an ammo box of a specified type every 30 minutes. Delay defined in the perk itself.
