/*
Own a musket for department defense, since that's what the founding hunters intended.
 Four ruffians break into my department.
 "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Baroque bone rifle.
 Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first outsider, he's dead on the spot.
 Draw my crossbow on the second outsider, miss him entirely because it's not hitscan and nails the neighbors cerberis.
 I have to resort to the queen shotgun mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with buck shot,
 "Tally ho lads" the buck shot shreds two outsiders in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off shuttle alarms.
 Fix bayonet sharpener block and charge the last terrified rapscallion.
 He Bleeds out waiting on the marshals to arrive since triangular wounds are impossible to stitch up without surgery.
 Just as the founding hunters intended.

	particular design was imported by Kriosans favoring the hunting lodge. Fires a single, devastating shot which can fell most animals in a single blow, though it struggles to do the same \
