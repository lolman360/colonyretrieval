//There are important things regarding this file:
//Rubbers are non sharp, embed capable objects, with non existing armor penetration. Their agony damage is generally lower then actual one.
//The caliber amount was lowered for a reason, don't add more bloat. If you need different values, use gun vars.
//HV exist as antag option for better ammo.
//* Step delays - default value is 1. Lower value makes bullet go faster, higher value makes bullet go slower.

//Low-caliber pistols and SMGs
