Your main objective, bluntly, is to make as much money as you can. Purchase and acquire goods, and sell them on for a profit.<br>\
Your Cargo Technicians will handle most of the grunt work and your Miners will acquire minerals. They are capable - utilize them well.<br>\
The vendors found throughout the colony are also operated by your organization. They make you money - ensure they are functional and well-stocked.<br>\
There is a market for contraband and more unscrupulous services. Venturing into this area may prove profitable, but comes with risk.<br>\
You do not receive a salary, but can fund yourself from the company account. Strike a balance between the needs of yourself and the wider company."

Your main duty is to keep the local company branch operational and profitable. Deliver goods, take payments and orders, and buy from scavengers.<br>\
In quieter times, use your initiative. Visit departments to ask if there's anything they need and try to sell them unusual items.<br>\
Busted lights? Broken vendors? Offer your services for a small fee. You may also find profit in the maintenance tunnels.<br>\
Avoid the deeper tunnels unless otherwise instructed, however - this domain is hazardous and for training mining specialists."
